# CustomShop
A simple lag-free way to buy and sell items to players

This source contains the files required to import as a single project into IntelliJ (the IDE currently used to create CustomShop).
Each version is seperated into its own module, with its own version of Spigot in its dependancies.
The artifacts are also contained in the project, after editing the code, simply build the artifact you wish to use in your server.
